# 100 Days of Coding Journey

Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey as I commit to coding every day for 100 days. Each day, I will tackle new concepts, projects, and challenges to improve my skills and knowledge in programming.

## Repository Structure

- **Day 1-100**: Each day's work will be organized in separate folders or files, showcasing my progress, notes, and any completed projects.
- **Daily Challenges**: A brief description of the challenge or topic I focused on for each day.
- **Resources**: Links to tutorials, articles, or documentation that helped me along the way.

## Goals

- Enhance my programming skills in Python.
- Build a portfolio of projects to showcase my abilities.
- Foster a consistent coding habit and share my learning journey with the community.

Feel free to follow along, contribute, or reach out with feedback! Letâ€™s code together!
